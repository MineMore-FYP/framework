beta — with negative skew
exponential — with positive skew
normal_p — normal, platykurtic
normal_l — normal, leptokurtic
bimodal — bimodal

A distribution could be any of the above. We would later on make this workflow dynamic by first drawing the distribution and then determining the best transformation mechanism to apply (in order to make it a normal distribution, eliminate/reduce effect of outliers etc.)

For the static workflow we would apply transformation in the following sequence;
